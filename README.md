## Abstract

Shor’s algorithm is a quantum algorithm that can solve the problem of finding
large prime factors of integers in polylogarithmic time. This paper gives an overview
of the RSA encryption scheme, quantum computing, quantum algorithms and Shor’s
algorithm. Finally, it describes a self-made implementation of Shor’s algorithm in a
quantum computer simulator using publicly available program libraries.
